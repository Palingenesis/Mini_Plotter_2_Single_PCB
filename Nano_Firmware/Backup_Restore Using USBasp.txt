This is instruction for backing up and restoring data on an Arduino NANO. AKA ATMega328p
Using AVRDUDE in the windows terminal.

First thing is know where your copy of AVRDUDE is installed on your computer.
	I am using the copy Arduino IDE uses and is installed on my E: Drive.
	If yours is in the default on C:, you will probaly only need to change E: for C:
	There is the location for AVRDUDE.EXE "E:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avrdude"
	There is the location avrdude.config "E:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf"
	
The files created/used will be in the location your are in in the windows terminal.
	You must be in the location the files are or you want them to be.
	
The file names used are:
	backup_flash.hex
	backup_eeprom.eep

If you are backing up a specific device, I surgest renaming them to somthing relevant.

Back up HEX and EEPROM (ATMega328p) with USBasp

"E:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avrdude" -C"E:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf" -v -p m328p -c usbasp -P usb -F -U flash:r:backup_flash.hex:i -U eeprom:r:backup_eeprom.eep:i


Restore HEX and EEPROM (ATMega328p) with USBasp

"E:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avrdude.exe" -C "E:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf" -v -p m328p -c usbasp -P usb -U flash:w:"backup_flash.hex":i -U eeprom:w:"backup_eeprom.eep":i
